# CadmusMqdq

This solution includes Cadmus MQDQ core components. As MQDQ has no parts of its own, the only project included here is the plugin to be used in the CLI tool.

## Cadmus.Cli.Plugin.Mqdq

This project implements a repository and part seeder factory providers for Cadmus Musisque Deoque (MQDQ).

The compiled binaries can be copied under a `Cadmus.Cli.Plugin.Mqdq` subfolder of the `plugins` folder in the Cadmus CLI tool to enable indexing and seeding MQDQ databases.
